/*about me:
Hi! My name is Mike (one of many), I'm 25 years old, and a returning CS student after a long hiatus from school. I like to play guitar, paint, problem solve, play video games, listen to music, and go hiking.
I have a sarcastic sense of humor with dry delivery, and many people think I am being serious or argumentative when I am just joking around.
I'm here on github to get my feet wet after a recommendation by some Google associates at a synposium.
I am currently learning C++, and once i feel confident enough with that, i will be moving to either java or python next.
My first time attempting to learn coding was when I was about 18 or 19, but I was never committed to actually mastering a languange until recently.
I live in NYC and would love to find others to exchange ideas with and code with. */
