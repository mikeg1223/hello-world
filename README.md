# About me:
Hi! My name is Mike, *one of many* but I'll be your favorite. 
In my spare time I enjoy reading, hiking, playing video/board games, watching anime, and trying new restaurants around my area. 
My interests within computer science are:
1. Natural Language Processing.
2. Computer Vision.
3. Cryptography.
4. Distributed Systems.
5. Algorithm design.

### Two truths and a lie: 
1. I almost died while hiking.
2. I'm ambidextrous.
3. I've given myself a tattoo. 
Contact me and find out which are true!
